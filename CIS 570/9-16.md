## ISA Design
- ISA defines how such statements are translated to machine code
- Think about a HLL statement like
    - x[i+1] = x[i] * 30;
    - What information is needed?
        - An object
        - where is it stored
        - how is it stored
- The ultimate goals of the ISA designer are
    - to create an ISA that allows for fast hardware implementations
    - to simplify choices for the compiler
    - to ensure the longevity of the ISA by anticipating future tech trends

## Design Goal: Fast Hardware
- From ISA perspective, must understand how processor executes instruction
1. fetch the instruction from memory
2. decode the instruction
3. determine addresses for operands
4. fetch operands
5. execute instruction
6. etc

- Fast instruction fetch and decode
    - an ISA perspective
- fast operand access
    - where do we store operands
    - how do we specify operand locations
    - we know registers can be used for fast accesses
- fast execution of simple operations
    - optimize common case
    - implementing single cycle operations
    - dealing with multi cycle operations
