Computer System
    program counter: address of next instruction

Microprocessor
    Arithmetic logic unit
    control unit
    memory address register
    memory data register
    program counter
    instruction register

Von Neumann model/architecture
    cpus can decode instructions and perform simple operations on register contents
    at the rate of one or more operations per clock cycle

Instruction Cycle
    fetch - get instruction - increment pc
    decode - translate instruction into understandable operations
    execute

Cpu cycle implementation
    program counter
        address of next instruction to be fetched
    instruction register
        instruction currentlly being decoded and or execution
    cpu state
        snapshot of all values in different registers

MARIE instruction set
    Bits 15-12 are opcode - what the operation is
        2^4 instructions - 16 instructions allowed and 9 total
    bits 11-0 are address - the memory you are trying to access are 4k
        2^12
