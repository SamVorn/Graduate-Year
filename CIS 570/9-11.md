## Hardware Heirarchy Abstraction

**Micro level**
- transistors
- gates
- bit adders
- ALUs
- processor

**Macro level**
- processors
- integrated system chips
- printed circuit boards
- Telephones, controllers, etc

## ISA vs Microarchitecture
**ISA**

- Specifies how the programmer sees program (instructions to be executed)
    - execution is as a sequence of instructions that are executed in an order (semantics)

**Microarchitecture**
- Specifies how the underlying implementation actually executes instructions
    - can execute ...

**Cont.**
* all major instruction set architectures today use Vonneumann model
* underneath (at the microarchitecture level) the execution model of almost all implmentations is very different
* Major difference between ISA and Microarchitecture
    - what happens underneath (that is not consistent with the Von Neumann Model) is not exposed to software

**Example**

What is part of ISA vs Uarch?
- Acceleration pedal: interface for "acceleration"
- internals of the engine: implement "acceleration"

**Implementation**
- can be different as long as it satisfies the specification (ISA)
    - Add instruction vs adder impementation
- Microarchitecture usually changes faster than ISA
    - why? software will break. (no backwards compatability)

**ISA**
- agreed upon interface between software and hardware
- what the software writer needs to know to write and debug system/user programs

**Microarchitecture**
- Specific implementation of an ISA
- Not visible to the software writer

**Microprocessor** 

## What is Computer Architecture
- Classical View: instruction set architecture (ISA)
