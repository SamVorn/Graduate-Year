## Union Concatenation Star

A * B 
- xy
- A * = {x1, x2, ..., xk| k >= 0 & each xi element of A}
- A = {00, 11}
- A * = { k = 0}
- A * is not infinite when A is the empty language
    - k = 0, A = epsilon

Sigma = {0,1}
- Sigma * = {empty, k=0}
                0,1, k=1
        00,01,10,11 k=2 

Sigma * is the universal set and universal language

If a language can be recognized by a DFA, it is a Regular Language

## The Closure Property for Regular Languages

``` 
The class of regular languages is closed under the union concatenation star 
```
> The Set of Regular languages

- if A is regular, then the complement of A is also regular
- if A * B is regular, then A intersects B is also regular

- swap the accept state with the initial state for a languages Complement

## NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)

L(N) = {w | w contains the substring 001}

### Formal Definition
```
NFA is defined by 5 tuples (Q, sigma, delta...)
1. Q is a finite set of states
2. Sigma is a finite alphabet
3. Delta is defined by Q x Sigma -> powerset(Q)
4. q0 is the sstart state
5. F <= Q is the set of accept states
```
```
If there is a path the machine accepts the string, accept
If in all paths, the machine rejects the string, reject
```

## Design of NFA
L1 = {w | w ends with 00}
