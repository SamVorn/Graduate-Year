# Non Regular Languages
What kind of language can be regular
1. if the language is a finite language
    - prove this by building a DFA/NFA or write a regular expression for the language
    - {x1, x2, x3, ..., xn}
        - x1 U x2 U x3 U ... xn
    - {01, 10, 11}
        - 01 U 10 U 11
2. Infinite language that only requires bounded/finite memory to recognize it
    - 1(1 U 0)* 0 = {10, 110, 100, ...}
    - B = {0^n1^n | n >= 0} 
        - this language is irregular (the amount of zeros have to equal the amount of ones)
        - we need to use states to memorize the amount of zeros
        - n can be infinitely large
- Example: 
    - C = {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s}
    - D = {w | w has an equal number of occurences of 01 and 10 as substrings}
        - C = {empty, 01, 10, 0011, 1001, ...}
        - D = {empty, 0, 1, 00, 11, 010, 101, 0110, 1001, 1101}
        - D is regular but C is not
        - to prove C is irregular use the pumping lemma
 
## Pumping Lemma
```
If A is regular => A has property P
B has property P =/> B is regular
(single directional) 
```
```
If A is not regular => A does not have property P
If A does not have property P => A is not regular
```
Proof by Contradiction
1. Assumption
    - A is regular => A has property P
2. Find Counter Example
    - Such that property P does not hold in A
    - contradiction
3. Assumption is wrong
    - A is not regular

## What is property P
```
If A is regular
there must exist property P (p >= 1) (pumping lemma)
s element of A where |s| >= p
S can be divided into s=xyz
that satisfies three conditions
1. for each i >= 0, xy^iz is element of A
2. |y| > 0
3. |xy| <= p
```
What does the pumping lemma mean?
- For any string coming from a language, as long as it is long enough it can be divided into x, y, and z
- s = x y(cannot be empty) z
- xy <= p
- i = 0 -> xy^0z =  xz element of A
    - pumping down
- S can be pumped = s can be pumped down AND can be pumped up
- if you want to show the string can be pumped, you have to show only one way of partition
- if you want to show a string cannot be pumped you have to show every single way it can be partitioned
