```
Rule: For each state of DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) there is exactly one exiting transition for each possible input symbol.
```
Set = {a, b, c}
+ you must have at least one transition, a, b, and c

State Q1 is off, State Q2 is on, Action 1 is turn on, Action 2 is turn off

Turn off -> turn on -> turn on
- 0 -> 1 -> 1
- you remain in Q1
    - you transition from Q1 to Q2 to Q2

> language of machine M -> the set of all strings that M accepts

L(M) = {w | w ends with 1}

M recognizes L

M accepts w

M = (Q,Σ,δ,q0​,F)
## Conceptualizing the Example
q1 - 0 -> q2
q2 - 0 - > q1
L(M) = {w | w contains odd number of 0s}

Regex : 1* 01* (01* 01*)*
- any number of ones followed one zero
- followed by any number of 1s
- one zero followed by any number of even zeros

MFA

Design of DFA
- L1 = {w | w contains the substring 001}
- L2 = {w | w ends with 00}
- L3 = {w | w does not end with 00} - just reverse L2
- L4 = {w | w starts & ends with the same symbol}
    - {w | w starts and ends with 1} 
    - {w | w starts and ends with 0}

## Regular Operations
1. Union: A U B
    - {x | x element of A or x element of B}
2. Concatenation: A * B
    - {xy | x element of A and y element of B}
3. Star: A*
    - {x1, x2, x3...xk | k >= 0 and each xi element of A}
### example
A = {00, 11}

B = {01, 01}

- A U B = {00, 11, 01, 10}
- A o B = {0001, 0010, 1101, 1110}
    - A o B != B o A
