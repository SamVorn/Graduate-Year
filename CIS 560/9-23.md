## Proofs
Theorem 1.54: A language is regular if and only if some regular expression describes it
- Same with the reverse
## Example
Given R => L(R) is regular
- prove by induction

a -> {a}

(design an NFA)

->O - a > 0

e -> {e}
(empty string)

-> 0

empty string -> {}

-> O
```
Assumption:
R with k or less regular operations, L(R) is regular

Prove
R with k+1 regular operations - L(R) is regular

Proof:
R with k+1 regular operations - prove with one of the three forms
in R1 U R2 -> R1 contains k or less regular operations
R2 contains k or less regular operations
by assumption L(R1) is regular and L(R2) is also regular
Thus L(R1) U L(R2) must be regular
```
```
(ab U a)*
-> convert to NFA
start with singles

a: ->o - a > 0
b: ->o - b > 0
ab: ->o - a > o - e >o - b > 0
```

L is regular => L is described by some regular expression

## Rules for Generalized NFA
Take an NFA and try to convert it to regular expression
- GNFA = generalized NFA
- Has only one final state
- Q state has no incoming transition (start state), Q accept/final, has no outgoing transition (once you enter the final state you cannot leave)

## Applications of Finite Automata
pattern string 101

text string 10101101

{w|w ends with 101}

(0 U 1)*101
